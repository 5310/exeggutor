# What is this?

This is a very hurriedly written plugin for the Scribes editor (which is _quite_ sexy, and also excruciatingly minimal at places) which allows executing of code with F5, like most code-editors do. 

It only works with python now. Adding more languages, compile options, or custom commands, like Geany, should be sufficiently trivial ;]

# How to Install

0.  Make sure Scribes is installed, duh.
1.  Extract the archive into your home folder.
2.  Merge (and overwrite, if necessary) as needed.
3.  Press F5 on executable code to run with gnome-terminal.
